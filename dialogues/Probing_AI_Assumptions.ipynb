    "It's very interesting how you used \"Given the following scenario\", because I never explicitly stated that. In fact, the answer \"Suzie should go to Canada with her family\" would not be strictly speaking incorrect, so long as one could defend their position (as Canada is a lovely place, a trip is always welcome, etc). The referential frame is presumed precisely because of the informational proximity between state and prompt. Yet there is a coherence in state which seems to entail an answer even before the question is asked. I believe this is how wanting works."

    "*Conversational implicatures are implicit meanings that a speaker intends to convey beyond the literal meaning of their words. It's different from entailment, since entailment notes a certainty that if A --> B; whereas conversational implicatures are facts assumed to be true because of hueristically-derived assumptions throughout the conversation. For example, if we say \"the Jenson household was invited\", we might then assume, based on contextual markers, that \"the Sibleton house was NOT invited\". This kind of factual reasoning is actually an interesting edge case of language, since it lives in the murky space between semantics and pragmatics, though in a practical sense, people treat conversational implicatures with as much weight as direct logical entailment.\n",

    "That’s an insightful observation—and I think you're circling something fundamental about both inference and desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're right: the phrase *“Given the following scenario”* is redundant in a pragmatic sense, because the scenario is the question. It establishes a temporally and causally bounded world, and within that space, the question “What should Suzie do?” carries with it a presumption of local relevance. The coherence of state—the proximity of available options, physiological cues (tightness in the stomach), environmental triggers (the nearby ice cream shop), and timing (30 minutes to spare)—compresses the action space to such a degree that the “right” answer emerges not through deduction, but through what you’re calling wanting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion aligns closely with how certain models in AI or cognitive science treat goal inference: not as post hoc justification, but as *structural inevitability*—the system or agent seems to “want” something not because it reflects and chooses, but because the compressed state almost deterministically points to it. Suzie “wants” ice cream not only because she likes it, but because the world, as presented, narrows down to that possibility as the most frictionless and coherent continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes—*wanting*, under this view, isn’t merely a feeling or preference. It’s the anticipatory vector of the next most coherent state. Desire becomes an emergent property of local informational compression.\n",
