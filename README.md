# AI Dialogues

A public logbook of my most instructive exchanges with Large Language Models (chiefly GPT-4/o).  
Each notebook captures the **raw conversation** plus my **meta-analysis**—what I was probing, how the model replied, and why the interaction matters for research, product work, or philosophical inquiry.

> **Why publish the transcripts?**  
> 1. Demystify advanced prompt engineering.  
> 2. Exhibit GPT as a thinking partner—able to role-play, refine theory, stress-test edge cases, and accelerate code.  
> 3. Give recruiters and collaborators a window into how I leverage AI for deep work across strategy, investigation, and abstract reasoning.

## Catalogue

| Dialogue (Notebook) | Focus | Key Patterns |
|---------------------|-------|--------------|
| **Vector-based Semantics and Drift** | Semantic change, mechanistic interpretability, cognition | Open-ended theory → metaphor expansion → recursive refinement |

### Vector-based Semantics and Drift – Snapshot
*Explores how word vectors drift, mutate, and superpose over time, linking my “add/subtract” model with mechanistic-interpretability math and a chemistry-style bond metaphor. Shows GPT’s capacity to co-develop theory through layered, constraint-tightening prompts.*
